      <description>OverviewThe Titanic left the port of Queensland (now Cobh), Ireland on April 11, 1912 with 2224 passengers 1. On early morning of Monday, 15 April 1912, sank the “unsinkable” after a collision with an iceberg dragging more than 2/3 of the passengers down to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
Due to the insufficient number of means of survival, the possibility to get in lifeboats would have obeyed to some kind of considerations: from the ethical “women and children first” to the more practical proximity to the Upper Deck which is itself related to the cabin class and thus to the socio-economic class of each passenger (see here the different levels of the Titanic).</description>

      <description>BackgroundMany fitness enthusiasts focuse mainly on how often they practice and how heavy they can lift, and usually neglect to verify whether they do it well or not. Yet, injuries due to unnatural movements and overexertion were proved to be the most commonly occuring ones during free weight activities 1. With the increasing use of devices that are equipped with accelerometers it is now possible to quantify how well a movement is done.</description>
