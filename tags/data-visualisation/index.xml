      <description>IntroductionThis project makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device which counts the number of steps taken by an anonymous individual in 5 minutes intervals throughout the day. The dataset was collected within a period of two months (October and November 2012).
The variables included in this dataset are:
steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format</description>

      <title>Evolution of fine particulate matter pollution in the US</title>

      <description>Among the numerous air pollutants, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the most harmful to human health. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in charge of setting the ambient air quality standards, tracking the emissions of the pollutants into the atmosphere, and releasing a database on emissions approximatly every 3 years. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). For more details, see the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 using the base plotting system. The data used in here (in particular, the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”) are from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets.
library(sqldf)library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)# Estimate the memory usagepaste0(&amp;quot;As the dataset has 2880 rows and 9 columns, it requires about &amp;quot;, round(2880 * 9 * 8 / 2^20, 2), &amp;quot; Megabytes in memory.</description>
